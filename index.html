                    <p class="about">My name is Karla Estefania Avila and I am an aspiring software developer! I majored in Cognitive Science with a specialization in Human Computer Interaction and have a minor in Computer Science. I have experience with making websites, apps, and web apps, and I am passionate about helping people in any way I can. As a first-generation college graduate, a Mexican-American, and a woman, I feel that I bring a distinct perspetive. I hope to contribute to building the real-world metaverse and expanding my knowledge in AR! <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentColor" class="bi bi-geo" viewBox="0 0 16 16">

        <h3>Process-Improvement</h3>
        <p>During my last position, I had a coworker that created tools to help us complete tasks faster. I was part of a small team that helped come up with ideas for tools, and even created one myself. There was a process that I was solely in charge of and it could take a few minutes and was tedious work. I decided to learn C#, used a new API, and with some help from the coworker, I created a tool that changed the completion time from minutes to seconds. <svg class="watch" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentColor" class="bi bi-stopwatch" viewBox="0 0 16 16">

        <h3>#100Devs</h3>
        <p>During the pandemic, many of us were sent to work from home and some lost their jobs. Because of this, someone by the name of Leon Noel created an online bootcamp called #100Devs. I didn't learn about it until the second cohort started and had been following along but because of work, stopped about halfway through. I am currently going through the videos posted on YouTube and following along, since I have more free time. <svg class="code" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentColor" class="bi bi-code-slash" viewBox="0 0 16 16">

          </svg> I was committed to maintaining that active lifestyle and would go on walks, runs or hikes when possible. Playing both Pokemon Go and Pikmin Bloom helped keep me motivated to stay active, even when I was too tired or just lazy. After playing with old friends or making new ones, I am passionate about helping others be active while also having fun! <svg class="balloon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentColor" class="bi bi-balloon" viewBox="0 0 16 16">
